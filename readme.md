idTech1 and idTech2 UDP bot for Discord by [HCI]Mara'akate.

Currently only works for Daikatana, Heretic II, and HexenWorld.

Pings a master server, caches the server list then queries them
every so often (defined in app.config).

Bot can communicate via PMs with !help, !info <ip:port>, !servers, and !activeservers.

You need to add a channel id for the bot to report when a player joins a server and when it becomes empty.

You need to configure the app for a Bot and give it the appropriate permissions to post messages.
